**[Since Pyenv 1.2.24](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/pull/1797), this plugin's functionality is present in the core Pyenv, so this plugin is no longer needed.**

# pyenv-which-ext

**Integrate pyenv and system commands.** This pyenv plugin automatically
lookup system command if the specified command has not been installed in
pyenv.

## Installation

### Installing as a pyenv plugin

Make sure you have pyenv 0.4.0 or later, then run:

    git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-which-ext.git $(pyenv root)/plugins/pyenv-which-ext


### Installing with Homebrew (for macOS users)

macOS users can install pyenv-which-ext with the
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh) package manager.

*This is the recommended method of installation if you installed pyenv
 with Homebrew.*

```
$ brew install pyenv-which-ext
```

Or, if you would like to install the latest development release:

```
$ brew install --HEAD pyenv-which-ext
```

## Usage

Nothing have to do manually. Just installing the plugin lets pyenv to fallback to the `system` version.

## Examples

Let us say if you have 3 versions in pyenv.

```
$ pyenv versions
  system (set by /home/yyuu/.pyenv/version)
  3.4.0
  anaconda-1.9.2
```

If you use `anaconda-1.9.2`, you can use the `curl` installed in `anaconda-1.9.2`.

```
$ pyenv shell anaconda-1.9.2
$ pyenv which curl
/home/yyuu/.pyenv/versions/anaconda-1.9.2/bin/curl
```

Then, switch to the `3.4.0`. Without `pyenv-which-ext`, the pyenv refuses to execute the `curl` since it is not installed in `3.4.0`.

```
$ pyenv shell 3.4.0
$ pyenv which curl
pyenv: curl: command not found

The `curl' command exists in these Python versions:
  anaconda-1.9.2

```

So, it is the time to install `pyenv-which-ext`. This plugin lets pyenv to find the commands outside from pyenv if not found in current version(s).

```
$ pyenv shell 3.4.0
$ pyenv which curl
/usr/bin/curl
```
